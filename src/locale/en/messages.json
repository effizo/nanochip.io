  "This is the first circuit board designed in our Open Source project. board using the ESP8266 microprocessor developed by Espressif. ESP8266 WiFi Uno is designed according to the size of the Arduino Uno, so it is compatible with most Arduino Uno expansion circuits. In addition to the basic features of the Arudino Uno, the ESP8266 WiFi Uno can also connect to WiFi. Because of its outstanding features, this is a circuit board suitable for studying and researching to make IoT (Internet of Things) devices - data collection and control devices over WiFi. Currently the ESP8266 WiFi Uno can be programmed using the Arduino IDE, MicroPython, NodeMCU - Lua.":

    "This is a product designed and manufactured by IoT Maker Vietnam. IoT Maker welding station with small, compact, sturdy aluminum box, comes with high quality Hako 65W welding torch, fast heating. The temperature is controlled by an encoder and displayed on 8 LEDs corresponding to the temperature level. The encoder has the ability to rotate non-stop, so it is easy to adjust. Can be used with low power adapter (24V-2A), the welding torches will be heated slowly, without shock, as the small power adapter off suddenly.":"This is a product designed and manufactured by IoT Maker Vietnam.

    "An other circuit board developed in the Open Source project series. Is an Arduino Uno circuit board developed by IoT Maker Viet Nam, with more improvements. Use ATMega328P microprocessor paste instead of conventional pin plugs. Uses the popular Micro Usb type B port on the market, adding extra pins for the most popular modules such as OLED, Servo, common sensor module (temperature, humidity, light , ...). And of course IoT Maker UnoX can also be programmed on the Arduino IDE software, as a regular Arduino Uno board.":"An other circuit board developed in the Open Source project series.
